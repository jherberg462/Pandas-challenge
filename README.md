### Males make up the majority of the customer base, but Females spend more on average

Nearly 17 in 20 of paying customers are male, so any advertising campaign will need to target, at least in part males because they make up too high a percentage of the customer base to ignore. However advertising targeted towards females should be more efficient because they tend to buy more expensive items, add spend more in total on average.

### The biggest market is players in their late teens and early 20's

The majority of the revenue comes from players in their late teens and early 20's. With the exception of players under 10 (there may be ethical concerns in targeting advertising towards customers in this age group), and players age 35-39 (the data point may be an outlier), these two age groups spend the most per person. Advertising money can be efficiently spent targeting these two age groups. 

### Each player tends to buy only one item

The overwhelming majority of purchases come from people who have purchased only one item. As such, it may be wise to stop targeting a person for advertising once they have purchased a single item.
