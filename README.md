### Males make up the majority of the customer base, but Females spend more on average

Nearly 17 in 20 of paying customers are male, so any advertising campaign will need to target, at least in part males because they make up too high a percentage of the customer base to ignore. However advertising targeted towards females should be more efficient because they tend to buy more expensive items, add spend more in total on average.

### The biggest market is players in their late teens and early 20's

The majority of the revenue comes from players in their late teens and early 20's. With the exception of players under 10 (there may be ethical concerns in targeting advertising towards customers in this age group), and players age 35-39 (the data point may be an outlier), these two age groups spend the most per person. Advertising money can be efficiently spent targeting these two age groups. 

### Each player tends to buy only one item

The overwhelming majority of purchases come from people who have purchased only one item. As such, it may be wise to stop targeting a person for advertising once they have purchased a single item.

### Average scores tend to not very much between grades

Each school's average reading grade for 9th graders is within 1 percentage point of the school's reading grades for all other grades. There is a little more variance in each school's average math scores, but the same is generally true for average math scores. This means if a school were to try something to improve test scores, they would only need to try it for one year for incomming 9th graders, and if successful, could implement the improvement for students in all grades. 

### Schools with a per-studnet budget of under $615/year perform better than schools with higher budgets

Schools that spend less than $615 per student per year have a much higher percentage of their students passing both math and reading tests than schools that spend more. Among students that are not passing both math and reading tests, the majority have failing grades of only one of math or reading. This means if a school is struggling with test scores, the solution is not to spend more money per student. 

### Charter schools tend to perform better than district schools

Charter schools tend to have both higher average test scores, and a higher percentage of their students with passing grades. Over 90% of students attending a charter school have passing grades on both math and reading tests, while just over half of students attending district schools have passing grades in both math and reading tests. This means if you have the opportunity, you should send your children to a charter school.
